Add the alias (once per Codespace)

In the Codespace terminal:

git config --global alias.ac '!git add . && git commit -m "$1" && git push'

Verify it worked
git ac "test commit message"


(If there are no changes, Git will just say nothing to commit.)

How you’ll use it

After you approve changes:

git ac "REQUEST-002: client startup fix"
