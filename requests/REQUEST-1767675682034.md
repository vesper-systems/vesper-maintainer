# REQUEST-1767675682034

## Goal
Improve backend startup reliability

## Affected Repos
backend-service, backend-config, backend-deployment

## Scope
Review and enhance initialization routines, add health checks, improve error handling during startup, and ensure dependencies are available before service bootstraps.

## Risk
Medium; changes to startup routines may introduce regressions or delay service availability if not thoroughly tested.
